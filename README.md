## About

> iban-utils is **zero dependency** a Node.js package designed to validate IBANs (International Bank Account Number). The package not only verifies the correctness of IBAN numbers but also allows you to extract detailed information about the bank and branch for supported countries (currently Polish IBANs). This can be particularly useful for handling payments, verifying account information, and ensuring financial data integrity in your applications.

> Whether you are developing financial apps, payment gateways, or banking software, this package simplifies the validation and extraction process, making it a must-have for any developer dealing with IBANs. Additional country support for data extraction will be added in future releases.
